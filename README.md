**Project Overview**
This project analyzes trends and relationships in movie budgets, revenues, and profitability using Python and visualization tools. The goal is to understand how the movie industry has evolved over time and which genres or types of films yield higher returns. Through visualizations like scatter plots, bar charts, and profitability timelines, it reveals:
1. The correlation between budget and revenue
2. Genre-based profitability
3. Industry growth and profit trends over the decades

This helps producers and stakeholders make informed decisions about budgeting and genre targeting.
